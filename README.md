KMeans Clustering Visualization \
This project is an interactive web application that showcases the workings of the KMeans clustering algorithm with multiple initialization methods. Explore how different approaches affect the clustering process with real-time, step-by-step visualizations.


🚀 Features \
🔄 **Initialization Methods** \Choose from four different initialization methods:

Random: Centroids are randomly selected from the dataset. \
Farthest First: Initial centroids are chosen to be as far apart as possible. \
KMeans++: Centroids are initialized in a way that accelerates convergence. \
Manual: Select your own centroids by clicking on the visualization. \
🎬 Visualization: Watch the clustering process in action! You can:

Step through the algorithm iteratively to see how data points are clustered. \
Run the algorithm to convergence and visualize the final clusters. \
🛠️ Dynamic User Interface: 

Generate new datasets at the click of a button. \
Change the number of clusters (k) and see how it affects the outcome.

Reset the visualization and experiment with different methods. \
📱 Responsive Design: Fully responsive and optimized for both desktop and mobile devices.
